# space-invaders

Space Invaders clone developed in Swift with SpriteKit.

The code is based on a tutorial published by Ryan Ackermann on Ray Wenderlich in 2016 and although it is not exactly the same after modifications and improvements on my part, all the credit goes to his code as it has helped me a lot and we have to be honest in the world of open source code.
