# space-invaders

Space Invaders clone developed in Swift with SpriteKit.

The code is based in part on a tutorial published by Ryan Ackermann on Ray Wenderlich's website in 2016 and although it is not exactly the same after many modifications and additions on my part, all the credit goes to his code as it has helped me a lot and we have to be honest in the 'open source' world.
